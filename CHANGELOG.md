## 1.0.0-beta.5

- A minor improvement has been made to the grammar file `example/json_parser.grammar`.

## 1.0.0-beta.4

- Google changed the source code formatting algorithms in the new version of the Dart SDK. This is causing Google to downgrade the software's rating. To prevent Google from downgrading this software, additional formatting was performed. Apparently, everything will have to be reformatted endlessly after the release of each new version of the Dart SDK.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

- Fixed issues with Google's requirements for packages hosted on pub.dev to prevent this software from being rating downgrade.

## 1.0.0-beta.2

- Fixed a bug in a sequence expression with a single child expression. Added generation of restore and update procedures in the `accept` handler.

## 1.0.0-beta.1

- Initial release.
